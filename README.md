# Literature

Literature or Canadian Fish is a 6 player card game, played in teams of 3. The aim of the game is to score as many half sets as possible. The team that scores more half sets wins. 
There are two half sets for each suits making a total of 8 sets. 
Small Set - Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five and Six
Big Set - Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen and King.

The team players ask the opposite team players for a particular card, provided they have a card from the same half set. The player can keep asking for cards until someone denies that they don't have that card. Then, the chance is transferred to that player.
